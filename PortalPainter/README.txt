Hi im wnlperez, an this is my portal gun drawer thing you will need: vtfedit (i put the download in the folder) the portal gun texures in the folder. PLS NOTE: the script was made with ai evry thing else i got off the internet. here is now to do it: 1: open the script 2:it will ask for the png brose to my folder and select it 3: PRESS SAVE NOT SAVE+VTF 4: in vtf edit put in the jpg/png and convert it into a vtf by using save as 5: locate v_portalgun folder in the pak01_dir folder 6: once done drag the pak01_dir folder onto the vpk.exe it will convert it into a .vpk 7: put it in the portal_dlc3 folder and put in [portal 2 dir here] by going on to steam and clicking the cog on portal 2 than go to mangage then 'Browse local game files' then put it there

alr now for the custom folder: do all the steps up there but insted of turning into vpk just put it in v_portalgun folder in the custom folder and go to the local files of portal and just put it there BUT USE THE v_portalgunP1.png insted of v_portalgunP2.jpg also rename it if it comes out like : v_portagun.vtf, v_portalgunP1.vtf etc into : v_portalgun.vtf this applyes to both portal 2 and portal
